vk_saver
========

Audio saver for vk.com. *nix.

vk_saver.py may be used as a standalone. The bad thing about it is it doesn't respect song names.
For that reason there are other 2 scripts which work together in order to save the songs and retain their names (in the form "Artist -- Song name.mp3").

The python scripts require wget. 
If you don't have it, an easy way to obtain wget is 

curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.15.tar.gz
